# WeGo POC - Software Engineering Project

This is an archive of my group project in a Software Engineering course where we simulated an agile team environment with our professor being the PO.

We developed a multi-cloud solution to simulate an autonomous delivery service using Mapbox, Python, Javascript, and MongoDB. This project is split into two parts: Supply and Demand. Supply handles the customer logic and data while Demand handles the autonomous vehicle aspect.

For example if a customer requests a delivery vehicle, the request flow is: Supply Frontend -> Supply Backend -> Demand Backend -> Database -> Demand Backend -> Supply Backend -> Supply Frontend.
